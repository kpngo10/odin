        <p>Cooking in Breath of the Wild is extensive, but there's no in-game system to track recipes. You can find Breath of the Wild (BOTW) recipes throughout Hyrule on banners and learn them from various NPCs. While learning them this way is neat, sometimes you just need a guide to help turn Link into a master chef.<br>
        <br>This page is a collection of all recipes in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sorted by meal and dish type.</p>
        <h2>BOTW Recipes: Entrees</h2>
        <p>These recipes are generally flexible, so use the best ingredients (the ones with status effects, for example) to get the most out of your meal. The entree recipes are sorted by their main ingredient.<br>
